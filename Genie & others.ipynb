    "### üéØ Overview\n",
    "- **OIDC Federation** allows **recipients** to use their own **identity provider (IdP)** for accessing **Delta Sharing** shares in Databricks.\n",
    "- The authentication flow uses **Open ID Connect (OIDC)** token federation to exchange JWTs for **short-lived OAuth tokens** issued by Databricks.\n",
    "- This enables recipients without access to a Unity Catalog-enabled Databricks workspace to authenticate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Benefits\n",
    "- **Fine-Grained Access Control**: More control over data access.\n",
    "- **Supports MFA**: Enhances security with Multi-Factor Authentication.\n",
    "- **Eliminates Shared Credentials**: No need for recipients to manage long-lived Databricks tokens, reducing security risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîß Use Cases\n",
    "- **User-to-Machine (U2M)**: Power BI, Tableau users authenticate via their IdP.\n",

    "# üõ†Ô∏è Bind Storage Credentials, Service Credentials, and External Locations to Specific Workspaces (GA)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The ability to bind **storage credentials**, **service credentials**, and **external locations** to specific workspaces is now **generally available**. This feature provides enhanced security and access control by preventing unauthorized access to these objects from other workspaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Workspace Binding**: You can bind sensitive resources such as storage credentials and service credentials directly to specific workspaces.\n",
    "- **Improved Security**: By isolating access to these resources, you can ensure that only users within the specific workspace have access to the sensitive data and services.\n",
    "- **Ideal for Data Isolation**: This feature is especially useful for scenarios where workspaces are used to isolate user data access, such as:\n",
    "  - Separate **production** and **development** environments.\n",
    "  - Dedicated workspaces for handling **sensitive data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Access Control**: Ensure that users in one workspace cannot inadvertently or maliciously access resources in another workspace.\n",
    "- **Streamlined Data Governance**: Helps in better data management and governance across different environments within the organization.\n",
    "- **Granular Permissions**: Provides a more granular approach to managing permissions and resources based on workspace-specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Development and Production Environments**: If you have separate workspaces for production and development, workspace binding ensures that only the relevant workspace can access sensitive data and resources.\n",
    "- **Sensitive Data Handling**: For teams working with confidential or regulated data, such as financial or personal information, this feature ensures that access is strictly controlled within a dedicated workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This feature brings improved security and data isolation capabilities, making it easier for organizations to manage their resources and enforce strict access policies across multiple workspaces.\n"
