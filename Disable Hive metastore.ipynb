    "- **Centralized Governance**: Access control, auditing, and data lineage for all data assets.\n",
    "- **Granular Permissions**: Control at table, column, and row levels.\n",
    "- **Unified Catalog**: Consistent catalog across all Databricks workspaces.\n",
    "- **Built-in Security**: Integrated with Databricks' roles, policies, and ACLs.\n",
    "- **Multicloud Support**: Works across Azure, AWS, GCP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hive Metastore (Legacy):\n",
    "- **Decentralized**: Tied to individual clusters, harder to manage across workspaces.\n",
    "- **Basic Permissions**: Limited control at the database and table levels.\n",
    "- **Limited Security Integration**: Requires external tools for some access control.\n",
    "- **Environment-Specific**: Supports fewer tools compared to Unity Catalog.\n",

    "### Step 1: Migrate All Tables from Hive Store\n",

    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Upgrade All Jobs to Databricks Runtime 13.3 LTS or Above\n",

    "## What Happens After Disabling the Hive Metastore\n",
    "\n",
    "- ❌ Any jobs running against tables registered to the **Hive Metastore** will fail.\n",
    "- ❌ Fallback mode is disabled.\n",
    "- ❌ Jobs running on Databricks Runtime versions below 13.3 will fail.  \n",
    "  *Currently running jobs will continue to work until they are terminated, but restarts on those clusters will fail.*\n",
    "- 🚫 The **Legacy** heading and **hive_metastore** catalog will disappear from the **Catalog Explorer** browser pane.\n",
    "- ❌ SQL commands that attempt to show the contents of the **hive_metastore** catalog will fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 Fallback Mode in Unity Catalog\n",
    "Fallback mode allows bypassing permission checks during migration, ensuring unmigrated workloads continue using existing credentials. It should be **disabled** after migration.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. As a **workspace admin**, log in to your **Databricks** workspace.\n",
    "2. Click the **user profile menu** at the top right and select **Settings** from the menu.\n",
    "3. Go to **Workspace admin > Security**.\n",
    "4. Set **Disable legacy access** to **Disabled**: This ensures that legacy access features cannot be used.\n",
    "5. To ensure that the new setting has taken effect, wait approximately **five minutes**.\n",
    "6. Restart all running clusters.\n",
